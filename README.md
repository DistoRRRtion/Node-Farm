This mini application is written in Node.js and demonstrates the following concepts:

- Reading and writing files using the built-in fs module
- Importing standard Node.js modules such as path and http
- Creating a custom module for file manipulation
- Creating a web server using http and handling routes with the url module
- Using template rendering dynamic HTML pages

The application allows features a basic routing system that directs the user to different pages based on the URL requested.

In this application, I learned how to work with the file system in Node.js, how to create and use custom modules, and how to create a simple web server and handle routes. Additionally, I learned how to use template engines to create dynamic HTML pages.
